This guide introduces the technical concepts Beamstack was built upon.

## Abstraction Layers

Beamstack acts as a low-code abstraction layer that allow users to deploy ML pipeline components with ease. This abstraction eliminates the need to modify SDK's, making deployment accessible to both beginners and experienced users.

Beamstack provides a monitoring stack consisting of Grafana and Prometheus that allows users to visualize the state of containers and resources within their pipelines.

## Infrastructure Agnosticism

Beamstack empowers users to create immediately build and deploy their pipelines regardless of their development environment or operating system. It serves all users consistently.
