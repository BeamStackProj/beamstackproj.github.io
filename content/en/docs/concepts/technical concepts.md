This guide introduces the technical concepts Beamstack was built upon.

## Abstraction Layers

Beamstack functions as a sophisticated low-code abstraction layer designed to streamline the deployment of machine learning (ML) pipeline components. By providing a high-level interface that simplifies complex operations, Beamstack eliminates the need for direct modifications to underlying software development kits (SDKs) and APIs. This abstraction not only reduces the cognitive load associated with setting up ML workflows but also enhances accessibility for users across various expertise levels, from novices to advanced practitioners.  

This entails:  

<details>
  <summary><b>Abstracted Configuration Management</b></summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Beamstack abstracts the complexity of SDK and framework configurations. By utilizing a simplified command structure, Beamstack enables users to set up and modify ML pipelines without requiring in-depth knowledge of SDK-specific settings or detailed configuration files.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Streamlined CLI Interface</b></summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Beamstack offers a robust CLI that facilitates the management of ML pipelines through intuitive command syntax. Users can execute various operations such as initializing projects, creating flink/spark clusters, deploying pipelines, and visualizing states of jobs with straightforward command-line inputs.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

## Monitoring and Visualization

Beamstack includes an integrated monitoring stack featuring Grafana and Prometheus, designed to provide comprehensive visibility into the state of containers and resources within ML pipelines. This monitoring stack enables users to track performance, troubleshoot issues, and optimize resource utilization effectively.  

This entails:  

<details>
  <summary><b>Prometheus Integration</b></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Real-Time Metrics Collection</b>: Prometheus is employed for real-time collection of metrics from various components within the ML pipeline environment. It scrapes data from containers, services, and infrastructure to provide detailed insights into resource usage, performance, and operational status.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Efficient Data Storage</b>: Prometheus uses a time-series database to store metric data, ensuring efficient querying and retrieval of historical performance data. This facilitates trend analysis and long-term monitoring.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Grafana Visualization</b></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Custom Dashboards</b>: Grafana integrates with Prometheus to offer customizable dashboards where users can visualize collected metrics through various types of charts, graphs, and tables. Users can create and configure dashboards to display key performance indicators (KPIs) and other critical metrics relevant to their ML pipelines.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Interactive Data Exploration</b>: Grafana provides interactive data exploration capabilities, allowing users to drill down into specific metrics, filter data, and generate ad-hoc queries. This interactive functionality aids in detailed analysis and troubleshooting.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Container and Resource Monitoring</b></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Container Metrics</b>: The monitoring stack tracks various metrics related to container performance, including CPU usage, memory consumption, and network I/O. This helps users understand the resource demands of their ML pipelines and identify any bottlenecks or inefficiencies.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Resource Utilization</b>: Prometheus collects data on resource utilization across different parts of the infrastructure, such as node status, storage usage, and network traffic. Grafana dashboards present this information in an accessible and actionable format.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Intuitive Stack Configuration</b></summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Setting up and configuring the monitoring stack is streamlined through Beamstackâ€™s CLI and graphical interfaces. Users can easily define metric sources, configure dashboards, and manage alerting rules without extensive manual setup.</li>
  </ul>
