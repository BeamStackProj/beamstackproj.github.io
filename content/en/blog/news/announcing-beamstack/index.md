## What is Beamstack?

{{< /imgproc >}}

Beamstack is a community of users developing reusable components for GenAI and ML workflow to simplify and make it easy to deploy and 
manage ML workloads from easily composable low-code components. Beamstack provides a robust Command Line Interface (CLI) that can potentially 
reduce pipeline deployment complexity and timelines drastically. It also possesses great monitoring and visualization features. Beamstack 
makes AI/ML on Kubernetes simple, portable, and scalable.

## Why Beamstack?
Deploying machine learning and GenAI workflows should be easy. By extension, managing those workflows should be easy as well, 
beamstack offers a solution that streamlines the deployment process of complex workflows. It is an open-source tool, easy to understand, and versatile. 

## The Beamstack mission

Our goal is to make the deployment of AI/ML Pipelines effortless and time efficient. Beamstack extends already existing features of kubernetes: 

- Easy, repeatable, portable deployments on a diverse infrastructure
  (for example, experimenting on a laptop, then moving to an on-premises
  cluster or to the cloud)
- Scaling based on demand
