What is Beamstack?
{.h1 .text-center .text-red}
Beamstack is an open-source framework currently under development, aimed at facilitating the 
deployment of Machine Learning and GenAI workflow pipelines with Apache Beam on Kubernetes. 

Beamstack provides a robust Command Line Interface (CLI) that can potentially reduce pipeline 
deployment complexity and timelines drastically. It also possesses great monitoring and visualization features.
